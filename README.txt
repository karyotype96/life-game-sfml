START GUIDE: 
- Download the zip, extract it somewhere, then navigate to bin/Release and click Conway's Game of Life.exe.
- Click on a square to change its state from dead to alive, or vice versa.
- Press any key except Backspace to advance the simulation.
- Press Backspace to clear the grid.

FOR THE UNINITIATED:

  Conway's Game of Life is a very simple game. The game takes place on a large grid. Each square in the grid
  is a cell, and cells have two states: alive and dead. The following rules determine whether a cell lives or
  dies:
  
- If a dead cell has three live cells adjacent to it, the cell becomes alive.
- If a live cell has two live cells around it, the cell stays the same.
- Under all other circumstances, a live cell will die.

  These simple rules allow for a game that is extremely simple, and yet so complex that people are constantly
  making new discoveries about the game.
  
  The Game of Life is known as a cellular automaton. Cellular automata simulate cell life and death, though
  the Game of Life does so on a very simple level. Other cellular automata are much more complex (and I plan
  on playing around with more complex simulations somewhere down the line).
